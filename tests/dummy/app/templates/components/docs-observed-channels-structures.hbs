<p>Due to differences in implementation across the various socket clients there are two basic types of structures for observed channels:</p>
<h3>Channels and events</h3>
<p>This allows specifying both which channels you want to watch and which events on those channels are interesting to you</p>
<pre>
  observedChannels: {
    channel1: ['event1', 'event2'],
  }
</pre>
<p>The code above would mean that we want to receive events event1 and event2 triggered on the channel channel1.</p>
<h3>Events only</h3>
<p>Unfortunately some implementations do not allow for distinction for events and channels. In those cases we can only listen to events, thus the structure is a flat array:</p>
<pre>
  observedChannels: ['event1', 'event2'],
</pre>
<h3>Tree shaking</h3>
<p>If you only want to include specific clients (e.g. only pusher), then you can specify it in the settings, like so:</p>
<pre>
  module.exports = function(defaults) {
    var app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
      'ember-socket-guru': {
        includeOnly: ['pusher'],
      },
    });
  }
</pre>
<p>This will make sure that only pusher client file and needed vendor files are included. By default all files are included.</p>
<p>Available keys: pusher, phoenix, action-cable, socketio.</p>
