<p>Due to differences in implementation across the various socket clients there are two basic types of structures for observed channels:</p>
<h3>Channels and events</h3>
<p>This allows specifying both which channels you want to watch and which events on those channels are interesting to you</p>

{{code-snippet name="observed-channels.js"}}

<p>The code above would mean that we want to receive events <code>event1</code> and <code>event2</code> triggered on the channel <code>channel1</code>.</p>
<h3>Events only</h3>
<p>Unfortunately some implementations do not allow for distinction for events and channels. In those cases we can only listen to events, thus the structure is a flat array:</p>

{{code-snippet name="events-only.js"}}

<h3>Tree shaking</h3>
<p>If you only want to include specific clients (e.g. only pusher), then you can specify it in the settings, like so:</p>

{{code-snippet name="tree-shaking.js"}}

<p>This will make sure that only pusher client file and needed vendor files are included. By default all files are included.</p>
<p>Available keys: <code>pusher</code>, <code>phoenix</code>, <code>action-cable</code>, <code>socketio</code>.</p>
